# BibTeX Tools for Processing Zotero Bibliography

Extract and tidy BibTeX entries for references in a Zotero library

## Requirements

The scripts in this toolset must be executed in Python 2 under Windows. You must have the Better BibTeX add-on installed on Zotero Standalone 4 and Zotero must be running.

## How to Use

To extract all references from your Zotero's My Library to a BibTeX file, run

    python zotero_to_bib.py

If you want to do both the extraction and conversion to HTML, run

    python zotero_to_html.py
